Welcome to my GitHub profile! In addition to being a student at [Novi University of Applied Sciences](https://www.novi.nl/) in Utrecht, where I am pursuing the Full Stack Developer program, I also lead Upxero, an innovative web design bureau specializing in creating visually stunning and highly functional websites.

Throughout my 12-month journey at Novi University, I have honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and techniques for both front-end and back-end development, ensuring that Upxero delivers cutting-edge solutions to our clients.
