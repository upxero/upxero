Welcome to my GitHub profile! I recently completed the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at [Novi University of Applied Sciences](https://www.novi.nl/) in Utrecht, a transformative journey that has equipped me with comprehensive skills in both front-end and back-end development. Alongside my education, I lead Upxero, an innovative web design bureau specializing in creating visually stunning and highly functional websites.

Throughout my intensive training at Novi, I immersed myself in a variety of programming languages and techniques, mastering tools for creating seamless user experiences. This proficiency allows Upxero to deliver cutting-edge solutions to our clients.
